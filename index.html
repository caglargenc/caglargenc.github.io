				<h1>PLAY-BIO:<br>
				DESIGNING FOR <br>MORE-THAN-HUMAN RELATIONS<br> IN EVERYDAY LIFE</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>In a world where biomaterials such as bacteria, yeast, mushrooms, and plants are often seen as mere ‘resources’, PLAY-BIO seeks to redefine our relationship with them through the lenses of More-than-human (MtH) approaches and play. The rise of MtH thinking challenges the traditional anthropocentric viewpoint, urging us to view other-than-human entities as active participants in our lives. While biomaterials have been explored in design research and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), the manifestation of cohesive MtH relations, such as care and kinship, in everyday life remains underexplored.</p> <br> 
				<p>PLAY-BIO is a Research Council of Finland’s Fellowship project that embarks on a journey to bridge this gap by exploring Games & Play as a transformative tool for designing and living with biomaterials.  The playfulness, emphasizing fun and joyful interactions over utility, has the potential to foster curious material engagements and caring MtH relations between humans and biomaterials in daily life. Here, Play-Bio explores design approaches that center such play experiences where biomaterials are seen as our social companions rather than consumables. To explore this, PLAY-BIO adopts a Research through Design (RtD) approach, focusing on widely accessible biomaterials like SCOBY (a bacteria and yeast culture), mycelium, and plant-based materials. The project unfolds in three phases: (1) first-person material tinkering and co-speculation workshops to explore the potentials for play between humans and biomaterials, (2) deploying and evaluating playful biomaterial designs in households to identify emerging MtH relations, and (3) synthesizing knowledge to create a Framework for Designing Play with Biomaterials.</p><br>
				<p>The expected contributions of PLAY-BIO are threefold. Firstly, it promises to deliver the examples of playfulness with biomaterials developed to foster MtH relations, such as care and kinship in everyday life, marking a scientific breakthrough in HCI, Design Research, and Material Engineering. Secondly, PLAY-BIO pioneers the study of MtH relations resulting from play designs with biomaterial in everyday life, bridging theoretical MtH concepts with practical applications in HCI, Design, and Sustainability Research. Lastly, the project aims to provide a Framework for Designing Play with Biomaterials, linking design approaches with their impact on MtH relations in everyday life. Through this comprehensive research endeavor, PLAY-BIO envisions a transformative shift away from the prevailing human-centered view, towards a society that embraces and cares for the other-than-human entities we coexist with on the planet, fostering harmonious futures.</p>
